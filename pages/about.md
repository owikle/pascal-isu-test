## About Pascal

*Descartes Pascal* (1870-1937) was a photographer, farmer, and pioneer seed corn breeder.
Pascal was born in De Witt, Clinton County, Iowa, where he raised corn, shorthorn cattle, and Berkshire hogs.
Pascal became interested in corn breeding after 1900 and developed the Grand Champion ear of pure bred Reid's Yellow Dent corn in 1907.
He also wrote and published articles on corn breeding; spoke at colleges, farmers' institutes, and chautauquas; judged corn breeding contests in Iowa; and served as secretary to the Iowa Corn Growers Association.
Pascal was also a practicing photographer.
